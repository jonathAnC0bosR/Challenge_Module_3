# Password generator 

## Description. 

This is a random password generator made with Javascript. Since IÂ´m just starting with javascript this challenge was very hard to do. I learned how the loops work and how can we call the functions with an addEventListener. Also I learned that a var that is declared inside a function it will only work inside that funcion because it is not declared in the global scope. 

## Instalation.

To use the password generator all you have to do is open the link inside this readme to open the webpage that allows you to use it. 

## Usage.

As a user you want to protect your account and your info, so with this password generator you can obtain a random password that will keep your information safe.
